# Infrastructure (Terraform IaC)

We will implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform as our required enhancement for a 2-person team.

Terraform will provision:
- DynamoDB table
- Lambda function
- IAM execution role (least privilege)
- API Gateway HTTP API
- Integrations between components

Benefits:
- Reproducible environment
- Clear documentation for cloud resources
- Follows industry cloud best practices
