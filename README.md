## Project Overview
This project implements a serverless Notes API on AWS. Users can create and retrieve short text notes via a simple HTTP API. The application demonstrates cloud-native architecture, managed services, IAM least privilege, monitoring design, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

## Repo Structure
- `/app` – Lambda function code (Python)
- `/infra` – Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- `/docs` – Proposal, architecture diagram, API design, SLO/monitoring
- `/project` – Final narrative document + required screenshots for submission

## Status
Phase 0 – Repository setup done
Next – Phase 1: API design & DynamoDB schema  

## AI Usage (Initial Note)
GenAI tools (ChatGPT) assisted in:
- Structuring project phases
- Planning repo architecture
- Drafting documentation templates

All code and IaC will be reviewed and corrected manually by team members.
Additional examples, prompts, and human-review notes will be added in the final submission.
